Introduction: The Way of the Program
====================================

The goal of this book is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python.

Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking.
Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed,
they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and 
very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you
mean for them to do. Thus, understanding computer code
involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you
wish would happen.
 
Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative
problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think
creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As
it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
practice problem solving skills.
